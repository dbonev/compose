# rm

```
Usage: rm [options] [SERVICE...]

Options:
-f, --force   Don't ask to confirm removal
-v            Remove volumes associated with containers

Removes stopped service containers.

By default, volumes attached to containers will not be removed. You can see all
volumes with `docker volume ls`.

Any data which is not in a volume will be lost.
